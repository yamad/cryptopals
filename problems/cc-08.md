# Detect AES in ECB mode

_Set 1, Challenge 8_
_https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/8_

[In this file](data/cc-08-data.txt) are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.

One of them has been encrypted with ECB.

Detect it.

Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and deterministic; the same 16 byte plaintext block will always produce the same 16 byte ciphertext.
